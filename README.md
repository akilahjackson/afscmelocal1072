# Visions for the future of AFSCME Local 1072
By Akilah Jackson, December 2016

After considering the needs of the board to come up with a new strategy for communication (particularly, electronic communication) I'm prototyping concepts to create an affordable and more openly integrated solution.

**First** it's important to note that I'm not alone in these efforts and after been given the blessings of the Board of Directors from my membership to pursue a drastic change that would bring us up to speed.

Will github-pages be the next home for AFSCME Local 1072 ? 

Time will tell, but for now, at least, it's a great way to build out static content for a site that's editable, version controlled, and even better, free.
